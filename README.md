arduino
=======

My libraries and projects for arduino (right now it's only a 433Mhz alarm)

You must put :
  * RCSwitch(.cpp and .h) in the librarues dir (from https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/)
  * the arduino dir with the arduino .h
  * the core dir with the compiled version of ardnuino dir (can get it from /tmp after having run the ide once)
